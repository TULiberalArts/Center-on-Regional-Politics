## Research, Policy Briefs and Publications
The Center on Regional Politics’ (CORP) scholars conduct groundbreaking public policy research and publish illuminating briefs and other publications. Their impactful work ranges from the academic study of major issues like education, economics, criminal justice, taxes and more. Their findings empower CORP to provide leaders throughout Philadelphia and its collar counties with the tools needed to properly address issues facing the public with policies that are as feasible as they are impactful.

CORP’s academic works do not lobby or advocate for specific bills because the center is not a special interests group. Instead, its public policy research is intended to provide the public and politicians with the best information possible so that they can make their own informed decisions.
