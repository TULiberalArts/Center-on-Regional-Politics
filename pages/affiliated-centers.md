## Pennsylvania Policy Database Project
The [Pennsylvania Policy Database Project](http://www.cla.temple.edu/pennsylvania-policy-database-project/) is a free, online resource that provides access to more than 160,000 state and news media records and enables users to trace and analyze with a few mouse clicks the history of public policy in the Commonwealth since 1979.  Designed for easy use by educators, students, researchers, policy makers, news reporters, and the general public, it is the first comprehensive state policy database of its kind.

The project was built by Temple University and five other universities with the support and cooperation of the Pennsylvania General Assembly.  Also participating were Pennsylvania State University, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania State University Harrisburg, and the University of Pennsylvania.

The Pennsylvania project is modeled on the national [Policy Agendas database](www.policyagendas.org), which allows users to track and analyze federal policy since 1946.  Created by political scientists Frank R. Baumgartner and Bryan D. Jones and funded by the National Science Foundation, the national project is housed at the University of Texas. Similar databases are under construction in a [dozen foreign countries](www.comparativeagendas.org) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
