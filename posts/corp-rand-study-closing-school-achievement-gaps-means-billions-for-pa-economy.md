This ground breaking RAND Corporation study projects that Pennsylvania could realize tens of billions of dollars in additional economic growth and move its students to the top of world and U.S. rankings by closing test score gaps based on race and ethnicity, family economic status, and parental education.  The study, believed to be the first of its kind at the state level, was commissioned by Temple University’s Center on Regional Politics.  Its findings support the bipartisan legislative commission’s recommendation now being considered in Harrisburg that the state increase funding for students from economically disadvantaged families.
