**June 9, 2016**<br>
This [Issue Memo](https://sites.temple.edu/corparchives/files/2019/08/Pension-Update-Memo-June-2016.pdf) is a compendium of actions taken or proposed in Pennsylvania and other states and cities in the last several years as they struggle to fund and reform public pensions.

It updates [the report of a bipartisan public pension working group](https://sites.temple.edu/corparchives/files/2019/08/CORP-Bulletin-Spring-Summer-2013.pdf) that identified options for funding and reforming public employee pensions in Pennsylvania. A number of the ideas in that report have been reflected in public policy debates in the General Assembly and in local governing bodies over the last three years. These include:

- developing stacked hybrid plans;
- repurposing existing revenue streams, such as from the Philadelphia sales tax to pay down pension obligations;
- ending the use of state aid to fund municipal pension administrative costs; and
- consolidating municipal plans with low funding ratios into the Pennsylvania Municipal Retirement System (PMRS).
