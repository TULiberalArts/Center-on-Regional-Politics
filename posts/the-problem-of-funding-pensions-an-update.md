**June 9, 2016**<br>
This [Issue Memo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FG3c22BpRBW7KT0xLxrKsdEGc5eD-R0U/view?usp=sharing) is a compendium of actions taken or proposed in Pennsylvania and other states and cities in the last several years as they struggle to fund and reform public pensions.

It updates [the report of a bipartisan public pension working group](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VRUjXudyuIrrwDFQDvvX5P8WPJP7ducg) that identified options for funding and reforming public employee pensions in Pennsylvania. A number of the ideas in that report have been reflected in public policy debates in the General Assembly and in local governing bodies over the last three years. These include:

- developing stacked hybrid plans;
- repurposing existing revenue streams, such as from the Philadelphia sales tax to pay down pension obligations;
- ending the use of state aid to fund municipal pension administrative costs; and
- consolidating municipal plans with low funding ratios into the Pennsylvania Municipal Retirement System (PMRS).
