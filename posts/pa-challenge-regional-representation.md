### Commentary: Can Pennsylvania Meet the Challenge of Changing Regional Representation?

**_Joseph P. McLaughlin, Jr._**
Can we find a common theme in the election results that have shaped today’s General Assembly and two studies recently published by Temple’s Center on Regional Politics (CORP)? If so, perhaps it is the importance of recognizing reciprocity as a fundamental strategy to address Pennsylvania’s widening economic and political divides.

The CORP studies reveal our state’s fiscal and economic imbalances. The first, published in January and titled [_A Tale of Haves and Have-Nots: The Financial Future of Pennsylvania’s Schools_](http://www.cla.temple.edu/center-on-regional-politics/pa-school-districts-financial-future-2019/), is a five-year fiscal forecast for all 500 school districts. The second, published this month, is an issue memo titled simply [_Southeast Pennsylvania and the Commonwealth Budget_](https://www.cla.temple.edu/center-on-regional-politics/southeast-pa-commonwealth-budget/). Both of these studies, and similar articles and reports produced by others in recent months, show the eastern half of Pennsylvania, and our region in particular, as economically and fiscally better off than the central and western regions.  

On the interactive maps that accompany the school finance report and displayed below, most Southeast districts, shown in black, are “Haves” and will face fewer challenges in balancing their budgets between now and FY 2022.  Yet, almost half, shown in red, are “Have-Nots” for whom the fiscal outlook is continuing budget shortfalls. In the rest of Pennsylvania, the imbalance is the reverse. Most school districts are red “Have-Nots” and fewer are black “Haves.” And for virtually all school districts, even in the Southeast, the state’s major subsidy increases will fail to cover state-mandated cost increases for pensions and charter schools.

The [second study](https://www.cla.temple.edu/center-on-regional-politics/southeast-pa-commonwealth-budget/) shows that the five-county Southeast region contributes more in revenues to the Commonwealth’s General Fund than it draws down in grants and subsidies. Yet within the Southeast are pockets of deep poverty and critical infrastructure needs that can best be addressed with statewide policies. And the Commonwealth itself faces daunting long-term challenges such as meeting the needs of a growing population of older citizens with a shrinking population of tax-paying workers, too many of whom lack the skills or education to compete in a global economy that is being transformed by technology. Recognizing these challenges, business and civic leaders across the state are building a Grow PA coalition to promote policies that lift the state’s economy to benefit all Pennsylvanians.  

Pennsylvania faces political imbalances, as well. For the last half century, our two great urban regions – the Southeast and Southwest counties – were represented by relatively balanced legislative delegations, with the parties competing in both regions for votes that were crucial to building statewide majorities. Each party had a stake in geographic regions where the other held a clear but not overwhelming majority. Each party had electoral incentives to support regional policy goals that had a measure of bipartisan support.  Controversial urban projects like convention centers, mass transit funding, and hospital care for uninsured city residents passed with the backing of Southeast legislators who also supported upstate water and sewer projects, rural highway funds, and forest and farmland preservation measures.

In just the last 10 years, the Southeast and Southwest regional delegations have moved further toward one-party dominance but in different directions, producing a party system that could deepen rather than bridge regional divides. The Southeast has become overwhelmingly Democratic – indeed, more than half of both Democratic caucuses represent the five Southeast counties -- and the Southwest has become somewhat more Republican. The shifts were powered largely by Democratic gains in the counties outside Philadelphia and Republican gains in the counties outside Allegheny. Republican representation in the large urban counties in the heart of the two regions – Philadelphia and Allegheny – has almost disappeared, as has Democratic representation in rural areas.

Conventional wisdom is that the replacement of moderate Republicans by liberal Democrats in the Southeast will result in a more ideologically polarized and gridlocked legislature. The upstate-based Republican caucuses will be smaller and more conservative but still in the majority, and the Southeast-based Democratic caucuses will be larger and more liberal but still in the minority. Studies have shown that when political parties mirror rather than mitigate society’s other cleavages, the results are not good for democracies.

A challenge to achieving the Southeast’s legislative goals is the relative inexperience of its delegation. Of the 54 members holding House and Senate seats for the first time, half – 27 – are from the Southeast. All but one – Senator Steve Santarsiero who served previously in the House – are just beginning to learn their craft as well as just beginning to develop relationships with colleagues, including those from other parts of Pennsylvania. Another 18 Southeast legislators are beginning their second or third terms. So 45 of the 80 Southeast members in the House and Senate have served two terms or fewer. An encouraging sign is that a number of the newer members have already achieved caucus leadership positions. Another is that as one relatively new member of the Philadelphia delegation said, hopefully, in a recent forum on why Harrisburg matters, “We are not burdened with the resentments of past conflicts. We can make a fresh start.”

The challenge for the Southeast will be to unify members representing very different districts behind issues that are regional priorities, to develop relationships with legislators from other regions with different problems, and to help them solve their problems in exchange for their help in solving ours. A unified Southeast delegation represents almost a third of the House and Senate. For the majorities needed to enact laws, that’s a lot of help.

This approach to dealing with the Commonwealth’s economic and political imbalances is as old as politics itself. Aristotle noted centuries ago that reciprocity is critical to the operation of economies and politics. Economic exchange between buyers and sellers, he said, “holds people together” creating a mutual interest in shared prosperity. And taking turns in ruling and being, he said, “saves cities”, which, in his time, were also states. 

For us, political reciprocity means a two-party system in which the legitimacy of each party depends on the existence of the other so voters can choose policies and change rulers. For legislators, it can also mean taking turns in voting to meet the needs of other economic regions and political communities. Let’s hope that political reciprocity can save not just cities but counties, towns, school districts, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
